# ONNX Explained

ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is an open-source format for representing machine learning models. It's the backbone of WhiteLightning.ai's portability, allowing models trained in TensorFlow to run on diverse platforms without retraining.

- **Interoperability:** Use the same model in Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, and more.
- **Performance:** Optimized for fast inference on CPUs, GPUs, and edge devices.
- **Compactness:** Small file sizes make it ideal for deployment anywhere.

With ONNX, WhiteLightning.ai delivers distilled AI that's as versatile as moonshine in a mason jar.
