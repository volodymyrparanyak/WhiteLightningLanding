# Overview

WhiteLightning.ai is a playground and toolkit for distilling the power of large language models (LLMs) into compact, efficient binary classifiers. Using knowledge distillation, we generate synthetic training data from user-defined problems and train lightweight ONNX models that run anywhereâ€”from your browser to edge devices. Think of it as moonshine AI: potent, portable, and fast.
